Nem here, I run a Minecraft server. And part of running this server is constantly asking the normalfags of the server what they think of Tox. Since they're the people we're trying to target, I'd figure their opinion is most important. Without further a-do, I present to thee, normalfag opinions:


## Q1: What would it take to make you switch from Skype?
* yeah maybe if it gets good reviews
* If other people use it 
* y'all niggas better have some kawaii ass emotes.

## Q2: What do you really want to see from Tox?
* PLEASE MAKE IT WHERE YOU CLICK THE 'X' IT CLOSES IT AND LOGS YOU THE FUCK OFF. (This has been said, and supported by at least 10 different people)
* i want it to be on every device. my iphone ipad and my mac
* NO ADVERTISEMENTS HOOOOOOOOOOOOLY SHIIT SKYPE IS TERRIBLE FOR THAT. (Everyone supported this)

## Q3: Your username would be something like a random string of 32 characters. How do you feel about this?
* Make it easy to send to people
* terrible
* can i set my username?
* How would I send this to people?
* I can't even memorize my Skype password and now you want me to memorize this fuckhuge string? No. Fuck that.

## Q4: What do you think of this GUI? [Image here](https://ipwnage.com/stuff/desktopui.png)
* I think the desktop UI looks fine, but have you considered different color themes you can apply? Not everybody likes gray. 
* yoooo thats mad OD sexy
* It looks really nice
* Skype knock off but without the clutter
* very clean and simple i like it!
* Beautiful, simply beautiful. Also, shaggy, lol.


## Other comments/praise/hate:
* I would definitely jump ship from skype.
* skype used to be big because it was good; no premium needed for conferences with video sharing and all that other good shit. now it's just relying on that momentum and slowing down from microsoft's vile influence
* >completely secure from the gubbernment; Hahhahaha But yea ill switch
* I might actually be the only one who likes Skype. I don't use it as much since I have TS3 now but if I want to have a private conversation with someone I do it on Skype. idk what projecttox is. i just read the link and nothing made sence im not a computer techy so someone might need to dumb it down for me. so as of right now, no i'll just stay with Skype and TS3.
